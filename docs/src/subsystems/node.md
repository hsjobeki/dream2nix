# Node.js subsystem

This section documents the Node.js subsystem.

## Example

> ./flake.nix

```nix
{{#include ../../../examples/nodejs_eslint/flake.nix}}
```

> ./projects.toml

```toml
{{#include ../../../examples/nodejs_eslint/projects.toml}}
```

## Translators

### package-lock (pure)

Translates `package-lock.json` into a dream2nix lockfile.

### package-json (impure)

Resolves dependencies from `package.json` using `npm` to generate a
`package-lock.json`, then uses `package-lock` translator to generate the
dream2nix lockfile.

### yarn-lock (pure)

Translates `yarn.lock` into a dream2nix lockfile.

## Builders

### granular (pure) (default)

Builds all the dependencies in isolation, moving upwards to the top
package.
At the end copies over all dependencies into `node_modules` and writes
symlinks for the bins into `node_modules/.bin`.

### strict (pure + best compatibility) (experimental)

Works almost the same as the granular builder. Not bulletproof stable yet.
Recommended: Try it out, it should work better than the current default builder, but is not yet released as default.

Features ðŸŒˆ

- Fully npm compatible
- No Patches / Overrides required (if "installMethod = copy")
  - (Most) Complex building of node_modules is fully implemented as python application, because it requires a lot of control flow.
  - Multiple outputs `["out" "lib" "deps"]` (explained below)
- Dedicated flattening of node_modules:
  - Conflicts are resolved during flattening the node_modules folder in favor of the highest semver)
  - Creates node_modules tree directly from package-lock.json informations. (Through the translator)
  - Creates node_modules tree with other lock files (such as yarn-lock) most optimal.
- consume itself:
  - lets you override/inject a package into your dream2nix project which is built with dream2nix

#### Usage

in `projects.toml` set the `builder` attribute to `'strict-builder'`

> ./projects.toml

```toml
{{#include ../../../examples/nodejs_alternative_builder/projects.toml}}
```

#### Override on the `strict-builder`

As currently the builder has three outputs: `$out`, `$lib`, `$deps`.
When overriding the `installPhase` the user is required to create all three out-paths:

> next.js export (e.g. for static sites)

```nix
installPhase = ''
    runHook preInstall

    next export
    cp -r out $out

    touch $deps
    touch $lib
    
    runHook postInstall
'';
}
```

#### Multiple outputs

##### deps

- content of `node_modules`
- consumable by `devShells`
- empty if package has no dependencies

```bash
    $deps
    /nix/store/...-pname-1.0.0-deps
    â”œâ”€â”€ .bin
    â”œâ”€â”€ @babel
    â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    â””â”€â”€ typescript
```

- package
- consumable as bare package
- containing all files from the `source`

```bash
    $lib
    /nix/store/...-pname-1.0.0-lib
    â”œâ”€â”€ cli.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

- standard composition
- consumable by most users
- `{pname}/bin/...` contains all executables of this package

```bash
    $out:
    /nix/store/...-pname-1.0.0
    â”œâ”€â”€ bin
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cli -> ../lib/cli.js
    â””â”€â”€ lib
        â”œâ”€â”€ cli.js 
        â”œâ”€â”€ ...
        â”œâ”€â”€ package.json 
        â””â”€â”€ node_modules 
```
